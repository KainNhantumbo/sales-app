# ✨ Ecommerce Platform (Next.JS + TS)

Welcome to this **ecommerce app** app repository, built with Next.JS and Typescript, and of course, with a flavour of tons of awesome community open source packages.

So, while learning something new, I wanted to embrace the adventure of creating this project.

I wanted to create an app similar to shopify but small in size, keeping the concept of creating a platform where users can create their virtual stores in one place, without worrying of infrastructure management by the user.

You can find the API source code [here](https://github.com/KainNhantumbo/sales-api).
